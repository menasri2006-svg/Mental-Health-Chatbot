Human-Style AI Refiner (LLM)

Safe, Calm, Supportive Response

🔹 1. Emergency Detection (Safety First)

Before any AI processing:

Input is scanned for self-harm or suicide indicators

Immediate crisis response overrides all AI

✔ Prevents unsafe generation
✔ Ensures ethical responsibility

🔹 2. Machine Learning Guidance Engine

TF-IDF Vectorizer

Cosine Similarity Matching

Trained on curated, emotionally safe responses

🟢 ML output is never shown directly
It acts as silent emotional guidance only

This ensures:

Interpretability

Stability

Zero hallucinations

🔹 3. Human-Style AI Refiner (LLM)

The LLM:

Reads ML guidance silently

Responds like a calm, caring human

Avoids diagnosis or authority

Uses gentle language and grounding tone

Identity Prompt Design

“Not an assistant.
Not a therapist.
A calm parent-friend.”

This prevents:

AI dependency

Clinical misinformation

Over-automation

🔹 4. Emotional & Stress Signal Awareness

Lightweight emotional inference using:

Sentiment polarity (TextBlob)

Linguistic cues

Speech filler detection

Outputs:

Stress level (Calm / Elevated / High Stress)

Estimated heart-rate range (non-medical)

⚠️ Awareness-based only — not diagnostic.

🔹 5. Context-Aware Wellness Logic

AI responses integrate with:

Mood-based wellness goals

Streak tracking

Daily affirmations

Creates a closed-loop wellness experience, not just conversation.

🛡️ Ethical AI Principles

✔ No diagnosis
✔ No medical claims
✔ No emotional manipulation
✔ No replacement of professionals
✔ Crisis override always active
✔ Privacy-respecting design

⚠️ SoulCare is a support companion, not a medical tool.
